  "Many home sellers get nervous about putting their house on the market during the winter months. They may worry that listing their home in November, December, January, and February is not worth it and is a waste of time and money because there are fewer people shopping for homes. Home sellers worry that buyers will not schedule showers and there will be no turnout at open houses.\n\nReal estate agents can reassure winter sellers by telling them that there are always people looking for homes no matter what season it is. More importantly, if you are selling during the winter, there will be less competition with less homes on the market. When inventory is low, it is easier to catch the eye of prospective buyers and can speed up the home sale process.",

  "A friend of mine decided to buy the condo she lived in and was told by the property manager / listing agent that she would need a non-QM loan. She was prepared to apply for a non-traditional loan so she reached out to see if I could help.. Non-QM loans typically have bigger down payments and higher interest rates. Being the person I am, I did a little digging, despite the agent insisting a traditional loan would not work. I explained to her the risks of trying and set proper expectations in case things did not go my way.. She agreed so we proceeded with the process. With the help of my team, we were able to get her a traditional conventional loan, which required a small down payment and better interest rate.  Early this month, as scheduled, we closed and she surprised me with these beautiful flowers and I was just so emotional. I really felt the need to share.. I am grateful to her for trusting me and for such a sweet gesture.\n\nSometimes all it takes is someone who wants to help. My inquisitive nature really serves me well in this industry. If there's a way I will find it! Please help me congratulate my client on her conquest.\n\nYou can be next, I am here to serve.. If you are looking to buy, or sell, I can help you.... \"sell? but you're a loan officer\" Yes, call me and I will tell you how I can help.\n\n#homeownership #homeloan #fhaloan #conventionalloan #clientappreciation #njrealestate #njlisting #listingagent #buyersagent #njrealestateagent #realestate #nonqm #homeowner",

  "It’s 2022… and that means it’s the perfect time to set your home goals! Setting home goals is like a way more fun version of New Year’s resolutions. Here’s how to set your home goals: First, think about how you want your home to feel. Are the vibes on point, or do you want your home to feel more cozy or homey? Next, think about what needs to happen to get you closer to how you want your home to feel. Do you need to reorganize your closet so that it’s effortless to use? Do you want to repaint a few rooms and move some furniture around? Or maybe you’re feeling ambitious and want to take on a kitchen remodel this year. Whatever you want to do, write it down! Lastly, think about the year as a whole and jot down any memories or new traditions you want to make in your home. Once you have all your goals written down, consider making them cute and printing them out. You can tack it to a pinboard or put it in your journal, so your home goals for 2022 are always close by. 🍾 What are some of your 2022 goals? Let me know in the comments!",

  "Why Inflation Shouldn’t Stop You from Buying a Home in 2022\n\nIf you’re following along with the news today, you’re probably hearing a lot about record-breaking home prices, rising consumer costs, supply chain constraints, and more. And if you’re thinking about purchasing a home this year, all of these inflationary concerns are likely making you wonder if you should wait to buy. Investopedia explains that during a period of high inflation, prices rise across the board. And while home prices aren’t immune from this increase, here’s why inflation shouldn’t stop you from buying a home in 2022.\n\nHome prices have been increasing for quite some time, and experts say they’re going to continue to climb throughout 2022. Buying a home allows you to lock in your monthly mortgage payment for the foreseeable future. That means as other prices rise, your monthly payment will be consistent thanks to your fixed-rate...\n#expertanswers #stayinformed #staycurrent",

  "🚨📈 𝙄𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙩 𝙍𝙖𝙩𝙚 𝙐𝙥𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙚 - 1.11.2022\n \nIt’s been a bumpy ride as of late when it comes to mortgage-backed securities and ultimately interest rates.  As you can see in the chart below, tracking mortgage-backed securities, we have broken through three levels of support in the last week. What that means to you or your clients is that interest rates are continuing to climb. We have been seeing a steady increase over the last 12 months or so but the last few weeks have been more drastic than normal. I’ve been telling clients and referral partners for six months that I can see interest rates approaching 4.75%-5.00% by the end of 2022, and this still appears to be the case.\n \nFor those buyers who are on the fence or waiting until the spring or summer to purchase a home once \"the market settles\", I would strongly suggest reaching out to your mortgage professional to inquire about the cost of waiting should you decide to sit on the sidelines any longer.
